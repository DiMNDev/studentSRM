Once the server is up and running and connected to the database, you will be greeted by the record list of all the students in the database.

### `Add new students`

In the nav bar, click **_New Student_** to add a new student to the database

### `Edit existing students`

In the record list there is a **_yellow button_** that will allow you to update the student in that row.
